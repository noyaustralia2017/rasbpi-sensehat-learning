Raspberry Pi Learning for Students
The code within this respository was mainly used in my assignment when working with Raspberry Pi, SenseHat and Pi Camera in 2020. 
I would reccomend that you run the code using the Python 3 IDLE than using the Pi's inbuilt Thonny.

The learning resources available:
1) Reverse Park Sensor
2) SenseHat Data Logger and Camera Capture
3) SenseHat Data Logger and Camera Capture via Anvil
